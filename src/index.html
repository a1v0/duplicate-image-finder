<!-- 
    Plan:
    - import CSV file somehow (might have to be hard-coded)
    - parse the data
    - create a form
    - on click of a button, all images are loaded
    - once images are assessed, user clicks button again
    - next lot of images is shown
    - user has to manually delete files as necessary
